# ITS_Large_Scale
A Java based platform for traffic simulations
This code is developed and compiled together with the contributions of Oguz Ali Ekinci and Mehdi Maleki during their master thesis projects at Istanbul Technical University (TR) and Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). The code is far from perfect, however, we are planning to post updates to improve. We are also aiming to merge the code with SUMO software at certain maturity level for supporting the robotics and transportation communities interested in multi-agent simulations and interplay between micro, meso and macro-scale traffic models.  A relevant article will be submitted to IEEE Access explaining further details of use-cases. The paper DOI will also be given here in future updates.
